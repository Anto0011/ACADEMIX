To replicate the virtual environment follow these steps:

open the command line (cmd)
change directory to your project folder (cd [your project folder path])
install virtual environment library if not installed (pip install virtualenv OR pip3 install virtualenv)
inside the project folder create a virtual environment (python -m venv env)
activate the virtual environment (env/Scripts/activate.bat)
install the required libraries for the project (pip install -r requirements.txt OR pip3 install -r requirements.txt)
make sure to restart visual studio code for the changes to take effect
open project folder in visual studio code

and that's it,
have fun coding!
